# tiffanyHo_exploreOpenSource
This project is part of the Explore Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:  Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.  Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesn’t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?  My response to the prompt is below:

Tiffany
* Delilah could include more photos reflective/representative of her target audience. She can also start out by replacing a photo or two with young girls from a variety of backgrounds in the case that adding extra/more photos is too much for a start. In the future, Delilah can keep in mind who her target audience is and can make sure that any content she adds does so.

I agree! -Aditi
